    <h3><p>A Swedish company are introducing potato milk as a
         new &ldquo;super-sustainable &rdquo; member to the plant-based &lsquo;milk &rsquo;family.Plant-based ‘milk’ has become a 
         staple in the food industry with products made from oats, almonds and rice now readily available. However, some of these crops can be resource intensive. Looking for a more sustainable and easily harvested 
         alternative, Swedish brand Dug has turned to potatoes. That’s right, potato ‘milk’ is heading our way.
