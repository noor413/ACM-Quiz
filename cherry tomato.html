    <h3><p>The cherry tomato is a type of small round tomato believed to be an intermediate
         genetic admixture between wild currant-type tomatoes and domesticated garden tomatoes.
         Cherry tomatoes range in size from a thumbtip up to the size of a golf ball, and can 
         range from spherical to slightly oblong in shape. Although usually red, other colours 
         such as yellow, green, and black also exist.
